    # The Black Fog

    - [bold]Status:[/bold] Largely undiscovered.

    The black fog is your current location. It's a mysterious area of space that can't be observed using conventional methods, due to the effects of a dense nebula (i.e. the black fog) covering most of the area. It is said that what lies within the black fog contains many dangers, yet companies and other groups are willing to bet on getting their hands on a piece of one (including Nanotrasen, your employer), as the black fog is a place full of myths. Despite all of the efforts to explore this area, large portions of the black fog remained unexplored.
