    The State is a country located within the black fog. Little of them is known, aside from a number of anecdotes, that describe them as a worker-centric egalitarian society using archaic technology. Their scale could not be measured, apart from being huge. The one thing others know is that the State doesn't want you to enter their territory or otherwise disturb them.

    Soldiers of the State are referred to as "State Troopers".
