    Nanotrasen is your current employer and the owner of the station(s) you're currently living in. It is a massive conglomerate with 'ownership' over a dozen planets. They recently dabbled in the black fog, following a trend.

    A portion of their employees are born inside Nanotrasen-owned settlements, then employed directly from there.
