## Ward Mantis

You're basically the science counterpart to security's warden, as the right-hand mand of the Research Director. Why is it named 'Ward Mantis'? We don't know.

# Your duties as a ward mantis.
- You're pretty much are gonna have to watch over every artifact in captivity, every slime in captivity, or even every experiment conducted by your fellow researchers. This is especially made more important when the Research Director cannot be present, or becomes busy with other stuff.
- You have access to the science armory, a room housing a collection of tools to eradicate anomalies in the event of an emergency. You're only allowed to unlock the science armory, only if there's a real emergency involving an anomaly, like a shadow anomaly spreading haze everywhere.
- The science armory contains CHIMPS for eliminating rogue anomalies, pickaxes for use to clear rocks or enemies generated by said anomalies, and flashbangs for use to clear black hazes that obscure your vision.
