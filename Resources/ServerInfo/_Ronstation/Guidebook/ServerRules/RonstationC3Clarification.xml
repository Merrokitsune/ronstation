  # Core Rule 3: Please no erotic roleplay, shock content, or any other sexually suggestive content or themes.
  Sexual content is any explicitly or implicitly sexual reference to body parts, behavior, or sexual acts. Shock content is any behavior intended to disgust, disturb, or otherwise traumatize players in an out-of-character (OOC) fashion.
  This rule prohibits any and all forms of sexual and/or disturbing content, even if it is in the context of roleplay, even if consent has been acquired between any participating party. If you're asked to stop, then please stop.

  Lighter forms of affection like hugs and kisses are appropriate, as long as they are platonic.

  Simple character freindships do not count as "romance"; just don't push these friendships to romantic levels.

  Acceptable examples:
  - C3.1ae: Telling someone that they're being a dickhead.
  - C3.2ae: Telling someone that you're going to kill the captain, as long as it is clear that you mean it in character.
  - C3.3ae: Giving someone a hug for either no reason, or for any other non-romantic reason.
  Unacceptable examples:
  - C3.1ue: Emoting sexual acts.
  - C3.2ue: Erotica content.
  - C3.3ue: Erotic or sexual memes (e.g.: "Woody got Wood", "Hawk Tuah" and other variants, et cetera).
  - C3.4ue: Dedicating significant portions of rounds to romantic relationships, dating, or similar things.
  - C3.5ue: Emoting defecation or related acts.
