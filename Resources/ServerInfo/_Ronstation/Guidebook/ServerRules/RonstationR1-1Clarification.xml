  # Roleplay Rule R1.1
  R1.1.1: To play Ronstation, a low-roleplay (LRP) server, a sufficient degree of roleplay is required, though higher degrees of roleplay is encouraged, albeit not required. Other rules, besides this rule, apply. You are, for example, allowed to roleplay a rude character, as long as you fall within other rules. OOC concepts such as keyboard shortcuts, server administration, or other mechanics or concepts that are impossible to be discussed in-character without breaking immersion or the '4th wall' are prohibited from being discussed in-character.
  R1.1.2: Text-messaging acronyms, such as "lol", "wtf", "brb", et cetera; or emoticons, such as ":)", "xD", et cetera, are not allowed to be used both in-character, and as emotes.
  R1.1.3: Emotes should be given more effort to allow for immersion, for example, using gestures instead of "motions for you to order guns" or otherwise using the emote function as a way to chat.

  Examples of acceptable roleplay:
  - R1.1.1ae: Say "Haha, did you see what just happened?" using in-character chat.
  - R1.1.2ae: Say "He blew up for no reason!", "Gods blew him up!", or "Centcomm made him blow up!".
  - R1.1.3ae: Point at cheese.
  - R1.1.4ae: Point at cargo order console then emote "shoots finger guns".
  Examples of unacceptable roleplay:
  - R1.1.1ue: Say "lol did u c wat just happned" using in-character chat.
  - R1.1.2ue: Say "an admin explodid him!" using in-character chat.
  - R1.1.3ue: Emote "can you give me some cheese?" as a mouse.
